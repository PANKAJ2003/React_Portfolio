# Your React App

## Getting Started

To run this React app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-react-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-react-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start a development server and open your app in a web browser.



Replace `your-username/your-react-app` with the actual path to your React app's repository.
